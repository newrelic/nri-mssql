# New Relic integration for Microsoft SQL Server

The New Relic integration for MS SQL Server captures critical performance metrics and inventory reported by a SQL Server Instance. Data on the SQL Server Instance and Databases is collected.

Inventory and metric data is collected via SQL queries to the Instance.

## Configuration

A user with the necessary permissions to collect all the metrics and inventory can be configured as follows

```sql
USE master;
CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmppassword';
CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;
GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic;
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic;

-- Goes through each user database and adds public permissions
DECLARE @name NVARCHAR(max)
DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT NAME
FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model')
OPEN db_cursor
FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
	EXECUTE('USE "' + @name + '"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' );
	FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name
END
CLOSE db_cursor
DEALLOCATE db_cursor
```

## Installation and usage

For installation and usage instructions, see our [documentation web site](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mssql-monitoring-integration).

## Custom queries

To add custom queries, use the **-custom_metrics_query** option to provide a single query, or the **-custom_metrics_config** option to specify a YAML file with one or more queries, such as the sample `mssql-custom-query.yml.sample`

### How attributes are named

Each query that returns a table of values will be parsed row by row, adding the **MssqlCustomQuerySample** event as follows:

- The column name is the attribute name
- Each row value in that column is the attribute value
- The metric type is auto-detected whether it is a number (type GAUGE), or a string (type ATTRIBUTE)

One customizable attribute in each row can be configured by database values using the following names:

- The column `metric_name` specifies its attribute name
- The column `metric_value` specifies its attribute value
- The column `metric_type` specifies its metric type, i.e. `gauge` or `attribute`

For example, the following query makes attributes named `category_0`, `category_1`, `category_2` and so on.
```sql
SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories
```

### Specifying queries in YAML

When using a YAML file containing queries, you can specify the following parameters for each query:

- `query` (required) contains the SQL query
- `database` (optional) Prepends `USE <database name>; ` to the SQL, and adds the database name as an attribute
- `prefix` (optional) prefix to prepend to the attribute name
- `metric_name` (optional) specify the name for the customizable attribute
- `metric_type` (optional) specify the metric type for the customizable attribute

## Compatibility

Check the official documentation website for [compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/microsoft-sql/microsoft-sql-server-integration/#req).

## Building

Golang is required to build the integration. We recommend Golang 1.11 or higher.

After cloning this repository, go to the directory of the MSSQL integration and build it:

```bash
$ make
```

The command above executes the tests for the MSSQL integration and builds an executable file called `nri-mssql` under the `bin` directory. 

To start the integration, run `nri-mssql`:

```bash
$ ./bin/nri-mssql
```

If you want to know more about usage of `./bin/nri-mssql`, pass the `-help` parameter:

```bash
$ ./bin/nri-mssql -help
```

## Testing

To run the tests execute:

```bash
$ make test
```

## Develop locally

To develop locally on M1 we need to leverage a different image, having few limitations and forward the port:
```yaml
version: '3.1'
services:
  mssql:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge
    ports:
      - "1433:1433"
    container_name: mssql
    environment:
      ACCEPT_EULA: Y
      SA_PASSWORD: secret123!
      MSSQL_PID: Developer
    restart: always
```

To connect with a msclient simply start the service:
```shell
$ docker-compose up
$ sqlcmd -S127.0.0.1 -USA -Psecret123! -q "SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters WHERE counter_name = 'Buffer cache hit ratio' or counter_name = 'Buffer cache hit ratio base'"
```

To install `sqlcmd` you could run:
```shell
$ brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
$ brew update
$ brew install mssql-tools
```

Obviously, you could also run the integration and leverage the debugger.
